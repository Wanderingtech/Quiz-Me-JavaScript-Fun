# Quiz-Me-Javascript-Fun
Week 4 homework. A quiz created about JavaScript. 


## Objectives

This is wk 4 homework consisting of a timed quiz that has multiple choice questions that display one at a time. At the end of the timer or end of questions, final score is given with the option to input initials to be kept in a high score category. 

## Components 

Contains minimal HTML, basic CSS styling, and dynamically updated JS. Also incorporated JQuery. 

## Shout-outs
This required copious amounts of assistance from my tutor and classmates. Especially Keith Billings who was a huge help.

## Future Improvements

I would like to continue styling and create the high score component. So that when the user clicks high score it displays a list of high scores.
