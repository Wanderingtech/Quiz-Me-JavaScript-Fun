# Quiz-Me-Javascript-Fun
Week 4 homework. A quiz created about JavaScript. 


## Objectives

This is wk 4 homework consisting of a timed quiz that has multiple choice questions that display one at a time. At the end of the timer or end of questions, final score is given with the option to input initials to be kept in a high score category. 

## Components 

Contains minimal HTML, basic CSS styling, and dynamically updated JS. Also incorporated JQuery. 

## Future Improvements

This is a non functioning code so far. The timer portion will run on "start" button click. But not when joined with the question initiation. I haven't been able to successfully troubleshoot that my quiz questions don't appear on screen at all. I have a tutor appointment scheduled and plan on resubmitting this work when it is complete and running.
